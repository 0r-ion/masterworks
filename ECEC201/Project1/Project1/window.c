 *
 *   This function modifies the `house` array by updating the characters

 *   match the window's state in the `state` array.  If the window's
 *   state is 1, then the window is filled with the '#' character.

 *   window is filled with the ' ' character.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   house -- pointer to characters representing the house
 *
 *   state -- pointer to the game state array
 *
 *       x -- the horizontal coordinate of the window for which the
 *            state will be updated (zero indexed, with 0 being

/* Toggles the state of the window @ coordinates (x, y) in the game

 *
 *   This function modifies the `state` array by toggling the value

 *
 *       x -- the horizontal coordinate of the window for which the
 *            state will be updated (zero indexed, with 0 being

 *   Given the zero indexed coordinates (x, y) of a window, this

 *   array is toggled appropriately and that the graphics corresponding
 *   to that window are updated appropriately to reflect the new state.

 * Parameters:
 *   state -- pointer to the game state array
 *

/* Toggles the lights based on the user's window selection.
 *
 *   Given the user's choice of window number, this function updates the
 *   corresponding window's (or windows') state and graphics, as
 *   necessary.
 *
 *   Hints:
 *     -- A primary job of this function will be to convert the choice
 *        of the user into the zero indexed (x, y) coordinates of a
 *        window.
 *
 *     -- Converting between `choice` and the (x, y) coordinates will
 *        probably be easier if you internally number the windows
 *        starting at zero (i.e. 0 thru 8 instead of 1 thru 9).
 *
 *     -- This function will need to call one other function
 *        (perhaps multiple times).
 *
 *   For Step 2, this function will only toggle the window
 *   corresponding to the user's selection.
 *
 *   For Step 3, this function will toggle the selected window
 *   and its neighbors (as described above in the instructions).
 *
 * Parameters:
 *    state -- pointer to the game state array
 *
 *    house -- pointer to characters representing the house
 *
 *   choice -- integer corresponding to the user's window selection
 *             (an integer value within the range 1 to 9)
